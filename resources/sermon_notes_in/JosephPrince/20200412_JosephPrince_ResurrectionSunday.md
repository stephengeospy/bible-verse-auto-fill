Psalm 23:1-2 KJV
Dwells - “Yashav” - Sit down (to rest)
In OT, He is in secret and He is the secret place

Ephesians 2:4-7 NASB
“made us to sit together”

Our history with Jesus started at the cross, when God put us in Christ..

Who loved me and gave Himself for me..

John Bunyan was upset with about his holiness.. He heard was a voice, where is your righteousness and another voice said Jesus is your righteousness..

Just like God is outside time, the cross is also.. Thats why Jesus was able to die for past present and future.. Just like that, our Spirit man is outside of time and he is seated at the right hand of God..

Targum Jonathan wrote down the oral traditions of Malachi, Zechariah & Haggai

Proverbs 18:14
Sustain (‘kul’ - to protect) 
“Sickness” - Machela is the original Hebrew word..
Jonathan used the word “Corona” for sickness here..


“Throne” attitude

The year of time and space - The first 2 miracles of Jesus signify that..

The boat under storm, was immediately transported to the shore shortening both time and space
